Beginner Java Game

Here I am practicing writing java by creating a simple 2d snake game with no graphics just filling in pixels.
This game uses no external librabies, just the built in Java library Java2D and Swing. The game is fully functional and incorperates the folowwing features:

* Start screen, where the snake wont move until the player presses a direction input
* Dynamic Score
* End game screen that displays "Game Over", the players score, and "button" to restart (press SPACE bar)
* Full restart functionality without having to re-run the program

What I want to add:
* Game Menu - were you can press start before seeing the actual game grid
* Modes - Speed difficulty and Ghost mode where you cant see the snake body only the head

I learned how to make a basic game loop by creating this game and basics of using swing + Java2D
