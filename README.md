# Beginner Java Game

### (This was made using IntelliJ by JetBrain, other IDE's my require you to download an extention i.e VSCode)

Here I created a simple 2d game of Snake, with no graphics just filling in pixels. This will be a teaching app where learners can clone down the repo and 
You dont need to download any dependencies, as this game uses no external libraries. It is just built using the built in Java library, Java2D and Swing. 
They game spans 3 files:

## The game is fully functional and incorperates the following features:

* Start screen, where the snake wont move until the player presses a direction input

* Dynamic Score

* End game screen that displays "Game Over", the players score, and "button" to restart (press SPACE bar)

* Full restart functionality without having to re-run the program

What I want to add:
* Game Menu - were you can press start before seeing the actual game grid
* Modes - Speed difficulty and Ghost mode where you cant see the snake body only the head



I learned how to make a basic game loop by creating this game and basics of using swing + Java2D
